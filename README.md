# VSCode-Squirrel-Support

This Extension adds support for the [Squirrel Programming Language](http://www.squirrel-lang.org/) (specifically [Electric Imp flavored Squirrel](https://electricimp.com/docs/squirrel/learningsquirrel/)) and its associated .nut files.

From the author of Squirrel:
> "Squirrel is a high level imperative, object-oriented programming language, designed to be a light-weight scripting language that fits in the size, memory bandwidth, and real-time requirements of applications like video games" (or in Electric Imp's case, embedded ARM microcontrollers).
